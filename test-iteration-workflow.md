# Iteration Workflow Test Plan

## Test Scenario: Complete End-to-End Iteration Workflow

### Prerequisites
- Development server running at http://localhost:3000
- Valid GEMINI_API_KEY in .env.local
- Browser access to the application

### Test Steps

#### 1. Initial Analysis Creation
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/app
2. Enter a test requirement: "Create a user authentication system with login, registration, and password reset functionality"
3. Fill in form data:
   - Task Type: "Feature Development"
   - Goal: "Implement secure user authentication"
   - Components: ["auth", "user", "database"]
   - Inputs: "User credentials, email"
   - Outputs: "JWT tokens, user session"
4. Click "Analyze Requirement"
5. Verify analysis is generated and displayed
6. Navigate to "Analyse" page

#### 2. Edit Analysis Content
1. Click on "Edit" tab
2. Modify some goals, constraints, or dependencies
3. Add new questions or assumptions
4. Save changes
5. Verify changes are reflected in the analysis

#### 3. Create First Iteration
1. Add user feedback: "Please focus more on security aspects and add two-factor authentication"
2. Click "Create New Iteration" button
3. Verify loading state is shown
4. Verify new iteration is created with improved analysis
5. Check that iteration history shows 2 iterations

#### 4. Navigate Between Iterations
1. Click on "History" tab
2. Select different iterations from the timeline
3. Verify analysis content changes appropriately
4. Test comparison functionality between iterations

#### 5. Create Additional Iterations
1. Switch to "Edit" tab
2. Make more modifications
3. Add different feedback: "Add OAuth integration and improve error handling"
4. Create another iteration
5. Verify iteration number increments correctly

#### 6. Test Persistence
1. Refresh the page
2. Verify all iterations are preserved
3. Verify current iteration state is maintained
4. Test localStorage data integrity

#### 7. Export Functionality
1. Click "Export History" button
2. Verify JSON file downloads correctly
3. Check exported data contains all iterations with metadata

#### 8. Mark Satisfaction
1. Mark current iteration as "satisfied"
2. Verify "Create New Iteration" button becomes disabled
3. Test that satisfied state persists across page refreshes

### Expected Results
- ✅ All UI components render correctly
- ✅ API calls succeed and return proper data
- ✅ Iterations show meaningful improvements
- ✅ State management works across all components
- ✅ localStorage persistence functions properly
- ✅ Error handling works for edge cases
- ✅ Performance is acceptable (< 5s for iterations)

### Error Scenarios to Test
1. Invalid API key - should show proper error message
2. Network failure during iteration - should handle gracefully
3. Malformed iteration data - should validate and reject
4. Rate limiting - should show appropriate message
5. Large requirement text - should handle without issues

### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial analysis: < 10 seconds
- Iteration creation: < 8 seconds
- UI state updates: < 1 second
- localStorage operations: < 100ms
